# Networks-and-GNNs
A knowledge repository to work on the intersection of Graph Neural Networks and Comple Network Science

This repository contains both, a living review of literature and original thoughts. If you have either to contribute we welcome pull requests. We expect the contents of this repository to be published in a peer reviewed venue in some form eventually.
